Explain  how  a  class  dependency  graph  differs  from  a  UML  class diagram.

A dependency graph shows how classes depend on each other and is made by referencing 
existing code. It is useful when maintaining legacy code to know how changes can affect 
other parts of the code.

A UML class diagram shows the breakdown of class structures. The UML class diagram
shows the class attributes, methods, if they are public or private, and how they are 
connected to other classes. They are independent of the software.
