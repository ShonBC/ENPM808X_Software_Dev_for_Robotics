Describe the role of polymorphism in object-oriented technology. Give an example.

Polymorphism in OOP allows for multiple versions of a method to be defined. When the method is called
the program will run whichever one corresponds to the appropriate object class that called it. This allows 
for many class instances to call the same method but perform a different action based on the parameters 
passed to the method. An example would be if a class method called Print takes a string then would print 
out a message based off of a string passed to it. Then a second Print method is defined that takes a 
string and an integer, this method will print out the string multiple times based on the value of 
the integer passed.
