What is inheritance in object-oriented technology? Give an example.

Inheritance is describes the idea of a class using another class as a starting point for initialization. 
A parent class can be used to make a child class that inherits the parents attributes and methods. An 
example would be if a parent class called Car defined the company attribute then the derived class Truck 
would inherit the company attribute but may also define the color of the car.
